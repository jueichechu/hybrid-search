    "# Hybrid Search: BM25 & FAISS (OpenAI Embeddings)\n",
    "\n",
    "This project builds a hybrid retriever combining:\n",
    "1) BM25 algorithm (traditional keyword-based matching and searching, sparse retriever)\n",
    "2) FAISS with OpenAI embeddings (semantic vector-based similarity search, dense retriever)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Hybrid Search\n",
    "Traditional search methods like BM25 excel at exact keyword matching, providing relevance scores based on term frequency and document length, making them perfect for finding documents containing specific phrases. However, they struggle with capturing semantic meaning — if a document discusses the same topic using different words, it won’t match. Vector embedding-based search, on the other hand, understands context and semantics but sometimes misses exact matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating both approaches, we get the best of both worlds: precise keyword matching and vector semantic understanding. This creates a more robust search system that can handle diverse queries effectively."

    "### Core Concepts\n",
    "#### 1. BM25 (Best Match 25) - Keyword Search\n",
    "- Spare vector approach; Statistical ranking algorithm for text retrieval\n",
    "- Full-text search excels at keyword matching and relevance scoring\n",
    "- Scores documents based on term frequency (how often query terms appear) and inverse document frequency (how common those terms are across al documents), effectively ranking the documents by their similarity to the search query\n",
    "- Particularly strong for exact phrase matching\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Vector Search (FAISS)\n",
    "- Converts text into dense vectors in high-dimensional space\n",
    "- Captures semantic meaning beyond exact keywords\n",
    "- Enables similarity-based searching\n",
    "- Excels in identifying information that is close in meaning to the search query, even when there are no direct keyword matches\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Hybrid Approach\n",
    "- Combines results and strengths from both search methods\n",
    "- Uses weighted ensemble to balance precision and recall\n",
    "- Allows flexible tuning of search behavior"
